find the weightLossTotal  according to BMI 
ChatGPT
To find the weight loss total according to BMI (Body Mass Index), you need to calculate the initial BMI and the target BMI, and then find the difference in BMI. Here's the general formula for BMI:

�
�
�
=
weight in kilograms
(
height in meters
)
2
BMI= 
(height in meters) 
2
 
weight in kilograms
​
 

Let's first calculate the initial BMI:

initialBMI
=
initialWeight
height
2
initialBMI= 
height 
2
 
initialWeight
​
 

Then, assume a target BMI (it's usually recommended to have a BMI between 18.5 and 24.9 for adults). Calculate the target weight using the target BMI:

targetWeight
=
targetBMI
×
height
2
targetWeight=targetBMI×height 
2
 

Now, find the weight loss total:

weightLossTotal
=
initialWeight
−
targetWeight
weightLossTotal=initialWeight−targetWeight

Here's an example with a target BMI of 24:

javascript
Copy code
const initialWeight = 150; // in kilograms
const height = 200 / 100; // convert height to meters
const initialBMI = initialWeight / (height * height);

// Assuming target BMI is 24
const targetBMI = 24;
const targetWeight = targetBMI * height * height;

const weightLossTotal = initialWeight - targetWeight;

console.log("Initial BMI:", initialBMI);
console.log("Target Weight:", targetWeight);
console.log("Weight Loss Total:", weightLossTotal);
You can adjust the targetBMI based on your specific goal or recommended BMI range. Keep in mind that these calculations provide a rough estimate, and individual factors may vary.
