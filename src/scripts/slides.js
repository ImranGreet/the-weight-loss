      "This program has completely changed my life, because I am a diabetic and had previous difficulty in losing weight. Now, I eat much healthier, drinking more water, exercising and being optimistic. My sleep and the level of energy has improved a lot, I don’t crave junk food, fizzy drinks, sweets, I don’t make anymore late night visits to the kitchen and so many other positive changes.",

    description:
      "I’ve been overweight for a while and I’ve tried a few fad diets…. you lose a hell of a lot of weight… and then you put it all back on because it’s unsustainable to carry on eating that way. My appetite has completely changed thanks to the medication and reshaping my habits with my coach. I’ve also noticed my mood has gotten better, I feel happier than before. It's early days but I already feel this is something that will have a lasting positive impact on my relationship with food.",

      "I stopped playing rugby due to a shoulder injury and that was my way of keeping fit.  The medication I was prescribed has helped refocus me. The coaching has really helped keep that focus where I get the chance to check in regularly with my progress. It’s the first time I’ve been able to start a weight loss programme and stick to it",

      "Whilst the medication undoubtedly helps with the weight loss, for me, the biggest support is the counselling. My coach, Maria is really supportive. To have someone that gives you ideas on what you can change and then you hold yourself accountable which is what I think is needed for long term success.",
