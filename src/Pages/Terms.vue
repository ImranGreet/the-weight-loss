        Voy offers a medicated weight loss program that combines medication with
        1:1 coaching. With Voy’s Weight Loss Money Back Guarantee, customers who
        do not lose 10% or more of their body weight after six months on the
        program (and who satisfy the Terms and Conditions, below), will be
        entitled to a refund.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        Refunds will be prorated to reflect any departure from the 10% weight
        loss goal. For example, if you lose only 8% of your initial body weight
        after 6 months, you would be eligible for a 20% refund of the program
        cost.
      </p>
      <p>To receive a refund, you must:&nbsp;</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Book and attend at least 10 coaching sessions in the six months*;
        </li>
        <li>
          Give at least 24 hours notice if you are unable to attend a coaching
          session – failure to give this notice is allowable no more than
          twice;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        </li>
        <li>
          Actively participate in weight tracking by upload weight reading
          fortnightly for at least 80% of the program duration**;

          the program; and
        </li>
        <li>

        Refunds will be made to the payment method you used to make the original
        purchase.
